This project is about life of small organisms: * as Algae (Glon), # as fungus (Grzyb), @ as bacteria (Bakteria). There are also: + as dead organism 
and _ as a empty space. Every organism ages and if it exceeds its maximum age (defined by the count of simulation steps) it becomes a dead organism.
In each step of simulation, organisms can eat, reproduce or move.
Fungus looks for a dead organisms, Bacteria hunts algaes or other bacterias, Algae simply acquire food through photosynthesis
The begining of a simulation is in the start.txt file.
The end of last simulation will be saved in symulacja.txt file.

Project was build in QT Creator
